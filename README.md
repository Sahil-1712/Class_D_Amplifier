# Class_D_Amplifier
This project implements a Class D Amplifier using MOSFET-based switching and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) techniques. Unlike traditional Class A/B amplifiers, a Class D amplifier offers high efficiency (up to 90% or more) by operating the output stage transistors as electronic switches rather than linear gain devices.
